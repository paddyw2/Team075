### Nov 26 Updates
The reversiPOCmagic.py file has been updated to mirror the latest code from reversiPOC.py and to define all numbers by reference to our constant, SIZE_CONSTANT. Note how it is now set to 35, not 40, and everything looks the same just smaller. It will (probably) need more work in defining subconstants etc. but I think this is a good start - we can change the size of the board etc. and nothing will break.

### To Do:
 * Still need to work on sub constants, such as FONT_SIZE etc.
 * I might look into setting up the hints functionality

#### Misc Tasks
 * Looking through code, checking for inconsistencies etc.
 * Anything else you think of!
