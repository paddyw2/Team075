# Team075

### Nov 26 Updates
The reversiPOC.py file now has the ability to change the difficulty setting and to view the current move in progress. The file masterReversi.py has also now been updated to show what it would look like if the pieces were stamped with images, rather than just turtle fills. There is nothing in place for the orange indicator move, so that's the wrong colour at the moment.

### To Do:
* Still need to work on getting the coordinates and numbers set to constants
* I might look into setting up the hints functionality

#### Misc Tasks
 * Anything else you think of!
