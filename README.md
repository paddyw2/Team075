### Current program state:

Program currently takes user input on the command line and now stores the gameState in a lengthy string, as per the updated instructions on d2l.

The string change might not be necessary but it does say "store the game state in one string" in bold, and then "this is required" so I made the changes to be safe.

We won't need any of these changes in future versions so we can just revert back to the Oct 14th, fe6ba70 commit once the Task 4 demo is done.

### To Do for Task 5

Add clicking functionality and computer moves. The game must also select a first player at random.

#### Misc Tasks

Scoreboard
Research into displaying some form of pop up messages or end of game messages.
Design exit button
