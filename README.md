# Team075
### Current program state:

The click functionality, random user assignment, and intelligent computer move have now been added. You can also quite the game by clicking the top left corner but I've not added a visual button for that. The program should be fully working.

### To Do for Task 5

The bestMoveCalc function could probably do with the variable names converted into camel case. Comments could also be added to make the function easier to understand. Play around with the functions and see whether you can generate any bugs or strange outcomes (especially when it comes to skipping goes etc.) Someone could also create/design a quit button for the top left corner - you can use the game-state.py file as reference.

#### NOTE:

I've added a folder with various old files for using and a README with some extra info on what they contain. In this directory I've added an empty Task6.py file to be used for working on the next task.

#### Misc Tasks

 * Scoreboard
 * Research into displaying some form of pop up messages or end of game messages.
 * Design exit button
 * Anything you think of!
