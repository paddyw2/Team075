### Nov 26 Updates
The reversiPOCmagic.py file has been updated to mirror the latest code from reversiPOC.py and to define all numbers by reference to our constant, SIZE_CONSTANT. Note how it is now set to 60, not 40, and everything looks the same. It will (probably) need more work in defining subconstants etc. but I think this is a good start - we can change the size of the board etc. and nothing will break.

However, nothing also seems to change visually - I think this is fine. The multipliers get messy at some points (e.g. SIZE_CONSTANT * 11.25) but that's kind of an inevitablility of the button and text writing.

### To Do:
 * Still need to work on getting the coordinates and numbers set to constants
 * I might look into setting up the hints functionality

#### Misc Tasks
 * Looking through code, checking for inconsistencies etc.
 * Anything else you think of!
