### Dec 5 Updates
Hints functionality added.

AI2 and AI3 three have been swapped. They were also cleaned up to reduce the length, and both functions use AI1 to decide between moves they deem of equal value (for example, if there were two corner moves, the corner move that took the most pieces would be chosen). AI2 was also dumbed down a little to ensure that it is easier than AI3. The automated test confirms this, with AI3 consistently winning. However, I seem to have mixed results (I have beaten AI3 a couple of times, but seem to get destroyed at AI2...), but I put that down to me having played this particular game waay too much and also being bad at it. I trust the auto test more!

Also, the user is now prompted for difficulty at each game load/new game/program start. I showed the game to some people and they recommended this - the default difficulty is not very obvious otherwise.

### To Do:
 * Main project description/documentation
 * Test the code as much as possible, look for any bugs
 * Finalize/refine the background images

#### Misc Tasks
 * Looking through code, checking for inconsistencies etc.
 * Anything else you think of!
