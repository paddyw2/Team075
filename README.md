# Team075
### Current program state:

The click functionality, random user assignment, and intelligent computer move have now been added. You can also quit the game by clicking the top left corner but I've not added a visual button for that. The program should be fully working.

### To Do for Task 5

Play around with the functions and see whether you can generate any bugs or strange outcomes (especially when it comes to skipping goes etc.) Someone could also create/design a quit button for the top left corner - you can use the game-state.py file as reference.

#### NOTE:

I've added a folder with various old files for using and a README with some extra info on what they contain. In this directory I've added an empty Task6.py file to be used for working on the next task.

#### Misc Tasks

 * Research into displaying some form of pop up messages or end of game messages.
 * Design exit button
 * Anything else you think of!
